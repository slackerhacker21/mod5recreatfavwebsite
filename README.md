# mod5recreatfavwebsite
## Project Description
This project recreates a simplified version of Dribbble, a platform for designers to showcase their work. The website features a responsive navigation bar, a hero section, a carousel for featured projects, a grid of project cards, a table for upcoming events, and a contact form. It uses Bootstrap 5.3.0 for styling and responsiveness.

## Bootstrap Components Used
1. **Navbar:** A responsive navigation bar with links to Home, About, and Contact.
2. **Carousel:** Displays featured projects with sliding images.
3. **Cards:** Show individual projects with images, titles, and descriptions.
4. **Modal:** Pops up with project details when "View Details" is clicked.
5. **Table:** Lists upcoming design events.
6. **Form:** A contact form with name, email, and message fields.

## JavaScript Functions
These functions simulate future features for the website:
1. **validateEmail(email):** Checks if an email is valid (contains "@" and "."). Could validate the contact form.
2. **getRandomProject():** Returns a random project name from an array. Could feature a project dynamically.
3. **getTotalPrice():** Sums an array of prices. Could calculate service costs.
4. **addFeedback(message):** Adds a message to a feedback array. Could store contact form submissions.
5. **filterProjects(category):** Filters projects by category. Could organize the portfolio by type.

In the future, these functions could be integrated with event listeners and DOM manipulation to enhance interactivity.
